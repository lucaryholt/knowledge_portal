<h4>General</h4>
<p>
    RESTFul web services are services via HTTP requests. <br>

</p>
<p>
    The services make use of the HTTP request methods <code>GET, PUT, DELETE & POST</code>. <br>
    This enables us to have multiple services on the same end point/path. You can have the service return a list,
    when a user sends a <code>GET</code> request, replace a resource when a user sends a <code>PUT</code> request and so on.

<p>
    Insomnia and Postman are applications designed for testing RESTFul web services. <br>
    They enables the user to send HTTP requests and see the response.
    This allows for quick debugging of REST services without writing the software requesting and receiving.
