    Swift variables can hold many data types
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Types</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    Basic data types:
    <ul>
        <li>Int & UInt</li>
        <li>Float</li>
        <li>Double</li>
        <li>Bool</li>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Character</li>
        <li>Optional</li>
        <li>Tuples</li>
    </ul>
    Most of these are self-explanatory and function much like most other programming languages.
    A few of them will be explained more below.
</div>

<h4>Optional</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    This represents a variable that either holds a value or no value. <br>
    When declaring a variable, you can make it optional by using the <code>?</code> symbol:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    var perhapsInt:Int?
    </code></pre>
    This essentially sets the variable to <code>nil</code>.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    This is used a lot when a class holds a variable, that is not used all the time.
    Could be a document, where an image is attached optionally. Here you would enable
    the user to instantiate a document without an image.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    When you need to use an optional variable, you need to unwrap it, as the optional
    data type basically holds the value. There are different approaches to unwrapping. <br>
    The most straight-forward unwrapping is the <code>force unwrapping</code> method:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    perhapsInt!
    </code></pre>
    When using this method, it is imperative that the optional has an value or it will
    cause an exception being thrown or the app crashing. <br>
    This method is not used unless there is an explicit reason to do so.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Normally when unwrapping an optional value, you will test if there actually is an
    value before using it. This can be done various ways. <br>
    One way to do it:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    if myString != nil {
        print(myString)
    } else {
        print("myString has nil value")
    }
    </code></pre>
    Another:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    if let int = perhapsInt {
        int
    }
    </code></pre>
    The first method checks if the optional is not <code>nil</code> and then does something
    with it. The second checks if you can save the optional in another variable, meaning if
    it has an value, if it can then you can use that new variable. <br>
    They do basically the same, just use whatever suits you.
