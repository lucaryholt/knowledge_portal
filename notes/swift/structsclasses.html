    Structures and classes are general-purpose, flexible constructs
</div>

<hr>

<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    We know classes from other programming languages and the idea is the same in <code>Swift</code>.
    They can have properties and methods, with just the same syntax as defining constants, variables
    and functions. <br>
    You don't need to import a file to use a class or structure you have made in another file, Swift
    makes those classes and structures available automatically.

<h4>Comparing Structures and Classes</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    Both can:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Define properties to store values
        </li>
        <li>
            Define methods to provide functionality
        </li>
        <li>
            Define initializers, to set up initial state
        </li>
        <li>
            Be extended
        </li>
        <li>
            Comform to protocols
        </li>
    </ul>
    Classes have some additional capabilities:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inheritance
        </li>
        <li>
            You can check and interpret type of class instance at runtime
        </li>
        <li>
            Among others
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    You define classes and structures with the keywords <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code>:
    <code class="code-block swift rounded">
            struct SomeStructure { <br>
            &*//body<br>
            }
    </code>
    And:
    <code class="code-block swift rounded">
            class SomeClass { <br>
            &*//body<br>
            }
    </code>
    To instantiate a <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code> you use <code>()</code>:
    <code class="code-block swift rounded">
            let instance = StructOrClass()
    </code>
    This is very similar to how we do in other programming languages.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    To access a property you use <code>dot notation</code>:
    <code class="code-block swift rounded">
            instance.someProperty
    </code>
    This is both to get the property or to change it.
</div>

<h4>Types</h4>
<h5>Structures are value types</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    A <code>struct</code> is a value type, which means that if it is copied to a constant or variable,
    the value will be copied and not the reference. This is the same as when you copy an Int or a String.
    You will have to instances of the <code>struct</code>. <br>

</div>

<h5>Classes are reference types</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    Unlike <code>structs</code> <code>classes</code> are reference types, which means that if copied to
    a constant or variable or passed in function, only the reference will be copied, which means you will
    still only have one instance of the <code>class</code>.
