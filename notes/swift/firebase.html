    A comprehensive app development platform
</div>

<hr>

<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Firebase</code> is a platform that provide a lot of functionality when developing apps.
    It supports a wide array of programming languages, meaning you could develop apps for <code>iOS</code>
    in <code>Swift</code>, <code>Android</code> apps in <code>Kotlin</code> or <code>Java</code>, webapps
    in <code>Node.JS</code> or <code>Python</code> and use the same data.
</div>

<h5>Initializing</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    To setup your project with <code>Firebase</code> you need to follow the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup">setup guide</a>.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Firestore</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Firestore</code> is a <code>NoSQL</code> database and provides lightning fast realtime updates.
    It also offers offline support, where the data is updated in database and device upon reconnection to
    the internet. <br>
    In <code>Firestore</code> you can have multiple collections.
</div>

<h5>Add data</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    Adding data to <code>Firestore</code> in <code>Swift</code> is quite easy:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    db.collection("notes").document("New Note").setData([
        "title": note.title,
        "text": note.text
    ])
    </code></pre>
    Here we add a new document to the collection <code>notes</code>. We manually set the document ID,
    in this case <code>New Note</code>. Then we set the actual data with a <code>JSON</code> like syntax. <br>
    In most cases you wouldn't manually select the ID, but let the database give it an ID.
    If we simply omit the <code>New Note</code> in the document, then <code>Firestore</code>, will
    assign the document a automatically generated ID, but then we will not know the ID of the newly generated
    ID, which we will need in some situations. <br>
    There is a way to get the ID, when adding a new document. Instead of setting the data of the new document, in
    the same call that saves it, we can instantiate new document as an variable and then set the data afterwards:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    let newDocument = collection("notes").document()
    newDocument.setData([
        "title": note.title,
        "text": note.text
    ])
    </code></pre>
    Then we can access the ID of the newly added document with <code>newDocument.documentID</code>. <br>
    You could also handle the ID manually with the built-in function in <code>Swift</code>: <code>UUID()</code>.
</div>

<h5>Read data</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    You can read data either one time or listen for realtime updates, which really is the reason to use
    <code>Firestore</code>. To listen for realtime updates, you need to setup a <code>snapshot listener</code>.
    You set it up one time in the code and then it runs asynchronously from your app. <br>
    An example of this (from the Github project in the links):
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    func getNotes(){
        collection.addSnapshotListener { (snapshot, error) in
            if(error != nil){
                print("error")
            }else{
                var notes:[Note] = []

                if let documents = snapshot?.documents {
                    let count = documents.count
                    for i in 0...(count - 1){
                        let note = documents[i].data()
                            if  let title = note["title"] as? String,
                                let text = note["text"] as? String,
                                let id = note["id"] as? String
                            {
                                let note = Note(    title: title,
                                                    text: text,
                                                    id: id)
                                notes.append(note)
                            }
                        }
                }

                self.noteCollection = notes
            }
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
    In this code snippet, we have the function <code>getNotes()</code>. <br>
    Here we make a call to <code>collection.addSnapshotListener</code>
    (I have pointed <code>collection</code> to <code>notes</code> further up in the code).
    Then we define a closure with the parameters <code>snapshot</code> and <code>error</code>. <code>snapshot</code> holds the data
    that we get from <code>Firestore</code> and <code>error</code> holds any error that might have occurred. <br>
    Inside the <code>closure</code> we start with a check to see if an error has occurred and otherwise, we work with the data given.
    <br>
    Then we check if we actually have received any documents, if we have, we for-loop through them and unwrap the values.
    Those values then get added to a Note object, which is itself added to a Note array. <br>
    When the for-loop is done, we replace the class variable <code>noteCollection</code> with the new notes. <br>
    That class variable has the wrapper <code>@Published</code>, which then updates the views with the notes.
    Since the <code>snapshotListener</code> always listens for updates, we have an array that always is updated,
    making the view always updated.
</div>

<h5>Update and delete data</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    Updating data can be done with the same <code>setData()</code> function as when we add data.
    Then you simply need to point it to the correct document ID in the <code>document()</code> call.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    To delete data, you find a document (with <code>document()</code>) and call <code>delete()</code>
    on it. It's that simple.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Storage</code> is the part of <code>Firebase</code>, where you can store files, fx images.
</div>

<h5>Getting a file</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    To get a file, we use same kind of code, as when using <code>Firestore</code>:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    func getFile(fileName:String, note:Note) {
        let fileRef = storage.reference(withPath: fileName)
        fileRef.getData(maxSize: 5000000) { (data, error) in
            if error == nil{
                print("file download ok")
                if let image = UIImage(data: data!){
                    note.image = Image(uiImage: image)
                }
            } else {
                print("file download not ok. \(error.debugDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
    This function downloads and attaches an image to a Note object. <br>
    Here we start by making a reference to the file we need to download.
    Then we call the <code>getData()</code> and define a <code>maxSize</code>, so we don't
    risk starting a download of a file with a size, that the device can't handle.
    In this case 5 MB. <br>
    In the <code>getData()</code> function, we pass a <code>closure</code>, with <code>data</code> and
    <code>error</code> (much like getting data from <code>Firestore</code>). <br>
    Again we check for error, and if <code>nil</code>, we process the data.
    Then we unwrap the data by instantiating an <code>UIImage</code> object, with the data downloaded.
    <code>UIImage</code> is an <code>UIKit</code> object, which means we have to convert it to the
    <code>SwiftUI</code> class <code>Image</code>. This has an constructor, which takes an <code>UIImage</code>.
    Now the file is downloaded.
</div>

<h5>Upload a file</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    Uploading a file (an image in this case):
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    func upload(fileName:String, image:UIImage){
        let data = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 1.0)

        let imgRef = storage.reference(withPath: fileName)
        let meta = StorageMetadata()
        meta.contentType = "image/jpeg"
        imgRef.putData(data!, metadata: meta) { (meta, error) in
            if error == nil{
                print("file upload ok")
            } else {
                print("file upload not ok")
            }
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
    Here we start by getting the data, we want to upload to <code>Firestore</code> from the <code>Image</code>
    object. Here we choose to use <code>jpeg</code> format. <br>
    Then we make a reference to the file (essentially what we want the image to be called on <code>Firestore</code>).
    For <code>Firestore</code> to properly see the file as an image, we need to tell it that it is an image,
    we do this by setting the meta data <code>contentType</code> to <code>image/jpeg</code>. <br>
    Then we call the <code>putData()</code> function on the reference, and pass the data and meta data, along with
    a closure for error handling.
