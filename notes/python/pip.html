<h4>Usage</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    The most important use-case for <code>pip</code> is to install
    packages, that are used in python scripts. <br>
    An example of this is to install the <code>requests</code> package
    (used to make HTTP requests):
    <pre><code class="code-block rounded">
    pip install requests
    </code></pre>
    You can then <code>import</code> the <code>requests</code> package
    in a script and use it.

<h4>Requirements file</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    If you have made a python script, that takes advantage of a lot of
    pip installed packages and what to install use this script on
    another machine, the pip packages needs to be installed on that
    machine. <br>
    You could simply go through the packages and manually install each,
    but that would be trivial and could possibly take a long time (for
    instance, if it were not just one other machine, but many).
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Pip</code> allows us to make a document containing the packages,
    or requirements, and simply use this document to install the needed
    packages on the other machine(s).
    <pre><code class="code-block rounded">
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    </code></pre>
    Then you can simply transfer your script and the <code>requirements.txt</code>,
    to the other machine and run:
    <pre><code class="code-block rounded">
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    </code></pre>
    Then the packages will be installed and you can run the script.
