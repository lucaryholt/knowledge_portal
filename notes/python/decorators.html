    A function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it

    An example of a decorator:
    <pre><code class="code-block python rounded">
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            func()
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return wrapper

    def say_whee():
        print("Whee!")

    say_whee = my_decorator(say_whee)
    </code></pre>
    The result of <code>say_whee()</code> being:
    <pre><code class="code-block text rounded">
    Something is happening before the function is called.
    Whee!
    Something is happening after the function is called.
    </code></pre>
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    There exists a simpler way to use decorators with the <code>@</code> symbol:
    <pre><code class="code-block python rounded">
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            func()
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return wrapper

    @my_decorator
    def say_whee():
        print("Whee!")
    </code></pre>
    This does the same thing as above, but without having to write <code>say_whee</code> three times.
