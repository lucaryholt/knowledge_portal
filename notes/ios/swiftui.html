<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>SwiftUI</code> is a toolkit that lets us design app UI in a declarative way.
    That means that we tell <code>SwiftUI</code> how we want the UI to look and work,
    and then it figures out how to make that happen. <br>
    To understand <code>declarative UI</code>, we need to understand the difference to
    <code>imperative UI</code>, which was what iOS developers were doing before <code>SwiftUI</code>.
    <br>
    In apps with user interaction we often have a lot of states - is the user logged in, is
    the message unread and so on. In <code>imperative UI</code>, you would have to handle
    all that yourself and write code to transition between the states. <br>
    <code>Declarative UI</code> in <code>SwiftUI</code> handles that for us. We simply need
    to declare that we want the login screen shown, when the user is not logged in and
    <code>SwiftUI</code> makes it happen.

<div class="text-section text-info">
    "Thatâ€™s what it means by declarative: we arenâ€™t making SwiftUI components show and hide by hand,
    weâ€™re just telling it all the rules we want it to follow and leaving SwiftUI to make sure those rules are enforced."

    (Quote from 'Hacking With Swift - What is SwiftUI?').

    <code>SwiftUI</code> also works cross-platform with <code>MacOS</code> and other <code>Apple</code> platforms.

<h4>SwiftUI vs UIKit</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When <code>iOS 13</code> launched it launched with a new toolkit/framework <code>SwiftUI</code>, before
    that <code>iOS</code> apps where made with <code>UIKit</code>. <br>
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Drawbacks of <code>SwiftUI</code>:
    <ul>
        <li>It only works for <code>iOS 13</code> and older. Which means
            barring a portion of users from using your app. But seeing as <code>iOS 13</code> is supported all the way back
            to the iPhone 5, most people is able to update and use your app. <br>
        </li>
        <li>It is a very new framework and all elements are not yet implemented
            in it. This means that you may need to use <code>UIKit</code> elements, that you then adapt to the new framework.
            This can be a bit cumbersome, but over time, this should improve.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Benefits of <code>SwiftUI</code>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Easy to learn, code is simple and clean
        </li>
        <li>
            You can mix it with <code>UIKit</code> as also described in drawbacks
        </li>
        <li>
            Easy adaption of themes, such as light and dark mode
        </li>
        <li>
            Live Preview

<h4>List of items</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    In <code>SwiftUI</code> it is very easy to make a list of items.
    You can simply use the <code>ForEach</code> method on an array of items,
    and then fill it with, for instance, a <code>NavigationLink</code> for each item.
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    List{
        ForEach(repo.noteCollection){ note in
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView(repo: self.repo, note: note)){
                Text(note.title)
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Notes ðŸ“‹")
        }
        .onDelete(perform: repo.deleteNote)
        .lineLimit(1)
    }
    </code></pre>
    If this array is annotated with the property wrapper <code>@Published</code>,
    then the list automatically updates whenever a change occurs (like a <code>Firestore</code> update).
