    In <code>SwiftUI</code> you can use different wrappers
</div>

<hr>

<h4>@State</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>@State</code> is an wrapper we can use on variables to update the UI, when the
    variable changes. <br>
    Whenever the <code>@State</code> variable changes it updates the view and the <code>body</code>
    property is reevaluated.
    This could be a string that changes or a boolean that triggers another <code>View</code>
    to appear. It is a very powerful tool and it is almost impossible to design with
    <code>SwiftUI</code> without using it. <br>
    The picture below illustrates the <code>@State</code> flow. <br>
    <img class="image-xl border" src="/images/swift_state.png" alt="SwiftUI State Image"> <br>
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    To actually refer to a <code>@State</code> variable, we use the <code>$</code> symbol.
    If we have the variable:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    @State var isPresented:Bool = false
    </code></pre>
    We could refer to it like this:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented, onDismiss: saveNote, content: {
        NewNoteView(repo: self.repo)
    })
    </code></pre>
    This particular code snippet is a <code>sheet</code> that covers the screen with another <code>View</code>,
    whenever the <code>isPresented</code> bool is true. To do this without <code>@State</code>,
    we would have to manually update the view, when the bool changes.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>@Binding</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    From the documentation in <code>Xcode</code>:
</div>
<div class="text-section text-info">
    'A property wrapper type that can read and write a value owned by a source of truth.'
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    This sounds a bit mystic, but what it means is that <code>@Binding</code> allows us to declare that
    a value comes from somewhere else and should be shared both places.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    A use-case for this could be a view, where we have a <code>@State</code> variable, that is then
    changed in another view. In the view where we then change the variable, we would store it with a
    <code>@Binding</code>.</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Another example (from the link 'Hacking With Swift - What is the @Binding property wrapper?')
    is when working with a <code>sheet</code> element. The element already knows to change the
    <code>isPresented</code> boolean to false, when you swipe the sheet away. But if you wanted
    to do it with a button inside the view - for example, when saving something - you could do it
    with a combination of <code>@State</code> and <code>@Binding</code>.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>@Published</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>@Published</code> allows us to make observable objects, that automatically announce when
    changes occur. <code>SwiftUI</code> then listens for those changes and re-evaluates the <code>body</code>
    property of any <code>View</code> that relies on that data.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    To use the wrapper, we need to make the class, containing the published variable, conform to the
    <code>ObservableObject</code> protocol:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    class Repo:ObservableObject{
        @Published var notes:[Note] = []
    }
    </code></pre>
    In the class you can add the <code>@Published</code> wrapper to the variables you want the app
    to listen for.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Then in the class/struct where you want to use the <code>ObservableObject</code>, you need
    to use the <code>@ObservedObject</code> wrapper:
    <pre><code class="code-block swift rounded">
    @ObservedObject var repo = Repo()
    </code></pre>
    Without this wrapper, the changes from <code>repo</code> would be sent, but ignored.
