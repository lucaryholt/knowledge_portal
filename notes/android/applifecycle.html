<h4>Activity Lifecycle</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    The <code>Activity</code> class has a number of callbacks, that allow the activity to know
    that a state has changed - essentially what the system is doing to the process where
    the activity resides.
</div>
<img class="image-xxl" src="../images/android_activity_lifecycle.png" alt="Activity lifecycle">

<h5>onCreate()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    This must be implemented and should contain logic that only needs to happen once in the
    lifespan of this activity.
</div>

<h5>onStart()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    This callback is invoked when the app prepares the activity to enter the foreground
    and become interactive.
</div>

<h5>onResume()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    This is invoked when the activity enters the foreground and enters the <code>Resumed</code> state.
    This callback is invoked every time the user, for instance, receives a phone call or navigates to another
    app and comes back.
</div>

<h5>onPause()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    Invoked when the activity is no longer in the foreground. The execution of <code>onPause()</code>
    is very brief and is then transitioned to <code>onStop()</code>.
</div>

<h5>onStop()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    When the activity is no longer visible to the user, this is invoked.
</div>

<h5>onDestroy()</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>onDestroy()</code> is invoked because of either of two reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>
            the activity is finishing (due to the user completely dismissing the activity
            or due to <code>finish()</code> being called on the activity), or
        </li>
        <li>
            the system is temporarily destroying the activity due to a configuration change
            (such as device rotation or multi-window mode)
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
