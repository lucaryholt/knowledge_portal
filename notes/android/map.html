    Show Map in Android App
</div>

<hr>

<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    The easiest way to utilize Google Maps in an android app, is to
    (in <code>Android Studio</code>) to create a <code>Maps Activity</code>.
    This activity comes with a fullscreen layout of the map, a setup file
    and some default code.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The next step is to make sure that your app has access to the <code>Google Maps API</code>,
    this can be done by following a link in the setup file (<code>google_maps_api.xml</code>
    in the <code>values</code> directory). With this done you can run the app and see the map.
</div>

<h4>Fragments</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    Some points from the <code>Tutorials Point - Android Fragments</code> link:
    <ul>
        <li>A fragment has its own layout and its own behaviour with its own life cycle callbacks.</li>
        <li>You can add or remove fragments in an activity while the activity is running.</li>
        <li>You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI.</li>
        <li>A fragment can be used in multiple activities.</li>
        <li>
            Fragment life cycle is closely related to the life cycle of its host activity which means
            when the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the activity will also be stopped.
        </li>
        <li>A fragment can implement a behaviour that has no user interface component.</li>
        <li>Fragments were added to the Android API in Honeycomb version of Android which API version 11.</li>
    </ul>

<h4>LocationManager & LocationListener</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When using maps it is most often useful to know where the user of the app is located.
    To do this you can use the <code>LocationManager</code> and <code>LocationListener</code> classes.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The manager is the class that handles the "larger aspects" of the location, while the listener,
    is the more interesting part.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The listener lets us receive the location of the user and do something with that.
    If we were making a navigation app, this could be to update the focus of the map to the current
    location of the user - in real time.
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
    listener = new LocationListener() {
        @Override
        public void onLocationChanged(@NonNull Location location) {
            Log.i("PlaceInfo", "Location: " + location);
        }
    };

    locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0, listener);
    </code></pre>
    Here we instantiate the manager and listener. The listener is an interface, which is why
    we create an object from it and override the <code>onLocationChanged</code> method.
    This method enables us to do something everytime the location changes. <br>
    In the last line we actually set up that we get the location changes - here we can set
    how often and how much the location needs to change before <code>onLocationChanged</code>
    is called.
</div>

<h4>Markers</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    Markers can be added to the map, as a way to show different locations and
    you can allow users to place markers as a way to choose specific locations.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The way to add markers to a <code>GoogleMap</code> is to use the <code>addMarker()</code> method.
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    googleMap.addMarker(
        new MarkerOptions()
            .position(new LatLng(double latitude, double longitude))
            .title("Title of marker")
        );
    </code></pre>
    You can also add a custom icon to the marker. This is done by adding a
    <code>BitmapDescriptor</code> from a <code>Bitmap</code>.
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.drawable.resourceName);
    Bitmap scaled = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(bitmap, 100, 100, false);

    googleMap.addMarker(
        new MarkerOptions()
            .position(currentPoint)
            .title(textUri.toString())
            .icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromBitmap(scaled))
        );
    </code></pre>
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Long press on map</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    To be able to long press the map and do something with that location, you
    need to set a <code>OnMapClickListener</code>:
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    googleMap.setOnMapLongClickListener(latLng -> {
        // Here you can do whatever with the LatLng object passed in
        // Eg. adding a marker
    });
    </code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Get address from GPS - Geocoder</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    A common use case for Maps is to show a specific location for a address
    (navigate to your favorite pizza place) or get an address for a location.
    To do this we can use the <code>Geocoder</code> class.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Instantiate the <code>Geocoder</code> object:
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    geocoder = new Geocoder(getApplicationContext(), Locale.getDefault());
    </code></pre>
    The <code>Locale.getDefault()</code> part is to get the countries customes for
    addressing and so on.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Then we can use it:
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    List&lt;Address&gt; list = geocoder.getFromLocation(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), 1);
    </code></pre>
    This returns the address for the location.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Permissions</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    To use location data of the user device, we need permissions.
    This can be done this way:
    <pre><code class="code-block java rounded">
    if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED && ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions((Activity) this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}, REQUEST );
        return;
    }
    </code></pre>
    What this rather convoluted code example accomplishes, is that it checks
    if we already have permission and if not, then asks for it.
</div>
