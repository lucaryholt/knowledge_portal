<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    Define a value in <code>JS</code>: <br>
    <div class="code-block rounded">
        <code class="code-block-code">
            const x = 5; <br>
            const y = 6; <br>
            const z = x + y; <br>
        </code>
    </div>
    If you need to define several values at the same time, you can do so in the same statement: <br>
    <div class="code-block rounded">
        <code class="code-block-code">
            const name = 'Jens Jensen', age = 44, cpr = '123456-7890';
        </code> <br>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>'const' or 'let'?</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    In <code>JS</code> you can declare variables with three different keywords: <code>var, let & const</code>. <br>
    Before 2015 <code>var</code> was the only way, but now it is almost only <code>let & const</code>, that are being used.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>const</code> is used for variables that cannot be reassigned. <br>
    This does not mean that you can make changes to the value, but that you can not assign a new value to the const.
    <br>
    <div class="code-block rounded">
        <code class="code-block-code">
            const jsObject = {}; <br>
            jsObject.name = 'JavaScript Object';
        </code> <br>
    </div>
    The object <code>jsObject</code> now contains a KeyValuePair <code>name : 'JavaScript Object'</code>. <br>
    But if you were to do the following: <br>
    <div class="code-block rounded">
        <code class="code-block-code">
            jsObject = 2;
        </code> <br>
    </div>
    The result would be <code>Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.</code>. <br>
    You also can not do the following: <br>
    <div class="code-block rounded">
        <code class="code-block-code">
            const s = 'This is the s string'; <br>
            s = 'This is now the s string';
        </code> <br>
    </div>
    This would result in the same error. This happens because in the first example, where we changed the JS object,
    we did not change where the constant was pointing to, but simply changed the object itself. In the example with the
    string we tried to change the string, or rather we tried to change which string the <code>const</code> was pointing to.
    This is because strings are immutable in JS.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    If you were to do the same but instead use <code>let</code>, you would not get an error and <code>jsObject</code>
    , would now refer to a Number.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    A major advantage to using <code>let</code> over using <code>var</code> is that <code>let</code> stays within its scope,
    making it more predictable to use.
