<h4>General</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When making webapps there are a lot of use cases that can benefit from saving some
    data client side - log in status, preferences and so on. <br>
    There are two ways of doing this <code>cookies</code> and <code>WebStorage</code>.
    <code>Cookies</code> are the older way and saves data that only the server needs to see.

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When using cookies on a website, you are required to inform the user that you store
    them (because of GDPR). To this purpose you can use the <code>Osano Cookie Contest</code>.

<h4>localStorage</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>localStorage</code> is an implementation of the <code>WebStorage</code> API.
    This allows us to store information in the browser, that lasts even if the browser is closed
    and reopened.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The data is stored in a Key Value way, with the <code>localStorage.setItem(key, value)</code>
    and retrieved with <code>localStorage.getItem(key)</code>.

<h4>sessionStorage</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>sessionStorage</code> works in the same way, but only stores the data as long as the browser
    is open.
