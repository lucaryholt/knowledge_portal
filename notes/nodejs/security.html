    Authorization and Authentication, JWT, Sessions and Rate limiting

<h4>Authorization vs Authentication</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Authorization</code> is the process of allowing access to the system, while <code>authentication</code>
    means confirming identities.
</div>

<h4>bcrypt</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>bcrypt</code> is a password-hashing function, based on <code>Blowfish</code> cipher.
    The <code>npm</code> module <code>bcrypt</code> is an implementation of <code>bcrypt</code> for
    <code>Node</code> projects. <br>
    It contains two main functions <code>bcrypt.hash</code> and <code>bcrypt.compare</code>.
    The <code>hash</code> function hashes a plain text password for a given amount of rounds and returns the
    hash asynchronously, either with callback, <code>.then()</code> or <code>await</code>.
    <pre><code class="code-block javascript rounded">
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash('plainTextPassword', 10);
    </code></pre>
    This takes the string <code>plainTextPassword</code> and hashes it <code>2^10</code> times (1024) and returns something like:
    <pre><code class="code-block text rounded">
    $2b$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
    \__/\/ \____________________/\_____________________________/
     Al  Cost      Salt                        Hash
    </code></pre>
    The above is an example of a result of <code>bcrypt</code> hash. The first part, <code>Al</code>, is an indication of
    what algorithm is used (<code>2a</code> or <code>2b</code>). <Code>Cost</Code> is the amount of rounds. <code>Salt</code>
    is the salt used to hash this password and lastly <code>Hash</code> is the actual hashed password.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    The <code>bcrypt</code> hashing is very scalable as when computers get faster, password cracking becomes easier, but
    then you can just increase the number of rounds.
</div>

<h4>JWT</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>JsonWebToken</code> is a industry standard for encoding and decoding information.
    It is used in many webapps to authenticate and authorize users and keep these users logged in.
    The way is works is that you authenticate users by normal means (could be <code>bcrypt</code>),
    <code>JWT</code> then sign (using the <code>sign</code> function) a token,
    containing the information you want and then you send this token to the user.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>Tokens</code> are signed using a <code>secret</code>, this secret is the key to decoding the <code>JWT token</code>.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    This token is then (most times) saved in the users browser and then everytime the user wants to make a
    request (that is restricted from public use), the user needs to send this token along with the request.
    The server then uses the <code>verify</code> function, with the token and <code>secret</code>, and returns
    either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    Many systems that use <code>JWT</code> set an expiration date on tokens and then also send along a <code>refresh token</code>,
    that the user can use to get a new <code>access token</code>.
</div>

<h5>Scalability</h5>
<div class="text-section">
    As long as every server has access to the same <code>secret</code>, they can all verify tokens, made by other servers.
    This makes it easy to load balance a large number of servers, using a round-robin method.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Sessions</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    An alternative to using <code>JWT</code> is <code>sessions</code>, this is done server side.
    In <code>Express</code> we can use the middleware module <code>express-session</code>.
    This allows us to save data about users in the server memory - we can save states (logged in, logged out etc.)
    and anything else we would want.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    This is easier to set up and use than <code>JWT</code> as we only have to handle it server side, but
    it does come with disadvantages. You would not be able to keep users logged in across multiple servers,
    as only the server has information about this.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Rate limiting</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    To protect the server (especially its resources) from attacks like DDOS, we can use something called
    <code>rate limiting</code>.
    What this does is to prevent users from making over a certain amounts of requests in a given time frame.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>XSS</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When you work with user typed data and display this on a webpage, you run a risk of being
    vulnerable to <code>XSS</code> or <code>Cross Site Scripting</code>, where users can "inject" their own
    <code>HTML</code> elements, such as a <code>script</code> element. This could enable a
    user with malicious intent to run custom scripts on all clients using the webpage.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    A way to combat this is the <code>escape-html</code> npm package. This package replaces symbols with
    characters that is interpreted as the same symbol, but does not allow it to be treated as
    normal <code>HTML</code> elements.</div>
