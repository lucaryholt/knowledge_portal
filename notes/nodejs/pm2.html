    Managing applications on servers

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    When running a <code>webapp</code>, <code>REST-API</code> or something similar, it is important
    that the service has as little downtime as possible and while you can prevent many crashes
    with error handling, there is always the risk of a crash.
    This coupled with the fact that running an application over SSH without closing on disconnect
    isn't as easy creates a problem.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    <code>PM2</code> comes in handy here. It manages all the applications you want to have running
    while restarting them, if they for some reason crash. <br>
    <code>PM2</code> also offers different overviews for the running processes.
</div>

<hr>

<h4>Start after reboot</h4>
<div class="text-section">
    A problem that <code>PM2</code> does not solve out of the box, is that if the server
    itself crashes and reboots, it does not restart the processes and you will need to set up
    <code>PM2</code> again.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    To solve this you can run a command when you have your processes running.
    <pre><code class="code-block bash rounded">
    pm2 save
    </code></pre>
    This will save the current configuration to a file, that <code>PM2</code> reads on
    start-up and then launches that saved configuration.
</div>
<div class="text-section">
    This makes the downtime minimal even in the event of a temporary power failure.
